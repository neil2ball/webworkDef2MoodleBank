WeBWorK definition files can be exported to a .def format. This BASH script takes these files and translates them for use by the WeBWorK Opaque Server in such a manner that they can be uploaded to a Moodle question bank.

The original application that performs this approximate function is found here: https://github.com/mgage/setdef2moodlequiz

This script borrows from, adds to, takes away from, and roughly translates mgage's work.
